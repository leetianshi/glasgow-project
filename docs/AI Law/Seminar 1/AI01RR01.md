## 5. Note
A *neural network* can be described informally as a system of many simple **neurons** connected in (typically) **layers**. Each neuron holds a **numerical value** called its **activation**. Activations in one layer are transformed into the next layer via **weighted connections** (often with an **added bias**) and a **nonlinear activation function**, which together determine how information flows forward.
